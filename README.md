# MyProjectGoogle
Integrated the Google Map with iOS application and connected 3 places on the map with poly line of different colours. 

Markers on the google map to show the places is done based on the Lat-long values of the respective places. 

Since i have used simulator for testing the application.i have not used my location to get dynamically. and i have hardcoded 
my location to Bangalore Lat-Long values.
